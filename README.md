# Checkbox-to-Hide-Show
This snippet could be really useful for a variety of reasons. Hopefully, you’ll remember me when you need to do advanced customisation of the checkout and its fields.  In today’s snippet, we’ll add a new checkbox and a new “hidden” field — the field will display if the checkbox is checked, otherwise it will disappear.
